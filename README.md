# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Arsala

These days, I spend most of my time building [Grey Software](https://github.com/grey-software), a not-for-profit startup I founded in Canada to democratize software education.

**ðŸ’¡ If you're struggling with learning software development, connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arsalabangash/) with the message "Resources and Guidance," and we can create a self-paced plan for you!ðŸ’¡**
