# 👋 Hi, I'm Arsala

I'm passionate about lifting human consciousness through Art, Technology, and Education  

These days, I spend most of my time creating [Grey Software](https://github.com/grey-software), a not-for-profit startup I founded in Canada to democratize software education.

In the past, I:

- Interned twice as a Software Engineer at Google 👨‍💻
- Studied CS at UTM, where I was also a Teaching Assistant and Hack Lab coordinator 🎓
- Provided unpaid on-demand IT support for my friends and family 🤣
